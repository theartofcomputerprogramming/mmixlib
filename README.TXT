This directory contains
changefiles and 
supplementary source and header files
to create an MMIX library.
The functions composing the library can be
be used to recreate the mmix simulator and 
mmixal assembler. 
The main purpose of the library, however, 
is the reconfiguration of the individual 
pieces and the reasseablage of the pieces 
to create and experiment with variations
of the original MMIX simulator and assembler.
It ist further possible to incorporate these
pieces into larger programms (editors, debuggers,
development environments, ... ) by linking
these programs against a properly configured 
library.
